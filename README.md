# HousePriceDSML
With Real Estate Price Predictor, you can predict home prices and uncover potential money laundering in property transactions. This application not only helps in accurate price estimation but also serves as a crucial step in enhancing transparency and security in real estate dealings.

## Data Colletion 
+ Data for our housing price prediction model was collected directly from [591 Real Estate](https://www.591.com.tw/), a leading real estate website in Taiwan.

## Deployment
+ To be easy testing and interaction with my housing price prediction model, I deployed the model on a simple web interface. This website allows users to input various house features such as location, size, year built, and more, and then receive real-time predictions on housing prices based on the trained model.
